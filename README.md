### BookingGauger: Machine learning api for predicting number of accommodation days an online visitor will book.

#### Overview

This project builds an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) API and dash web application as an interface 
to request prediction of number of days to be booked for accommodation by a user. The intended enduser is an online booking client 
with data on user behaviour of their online visitors who access the booking platform (website) to make
reservations.

In order to allocated the necessary resources for accommodation booking, the available data is used to predict
number of days that an online vistor will book for accommodation.
